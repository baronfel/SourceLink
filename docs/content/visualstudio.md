# Enable Source Server Support in Visual Studio

You just need to check the `Enable source server support` in Debugging > Options and set the path for `Cache symbols in this directory`. The path is used to save source files too, not just pdb (symbol) files. They are cached in a subdirectory named `src`. No symbol (pdb) servers need to be enabled if the pdb files are distributed with the NuGet packages.
